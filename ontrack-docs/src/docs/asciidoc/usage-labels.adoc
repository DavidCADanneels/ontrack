==== Project labels

Projects can be associated with labels. This allows to classify them.

Labels are defined by:

* an optional category
* a name (unique within the category)
* an optional description
* a color (always given using the form `#RRGGBB`, for example black
  is `#000000`)

[[projects-labels-usage]]
===== Using the labels

Project labels are displayed in the home page, in the list of projects:

They also appear in the project page, under the project's name:

In the home page, projects can be filtered using labels. Several options
are available.

You can type parts of the label in the _Label_ filter box
at the top of the project list. This displays a list
of matching labels from which you can select an actual label:

Once the item is selected, the list of projects is filtered
accordingly:

You can also select the label directly from the _Label_ dropdown:

Finally, from the home page or from the project page, clicking on a label
will select this label as a filter.

[NOTE]
====
The selected filter is stored at browser level and is therefore
preselected the next time you go to the home page.

You can clear the selected label by either:

* emptying the _Label_ text box
* select _Clear_ in the _Label_ dropdown

Note that upon a label selection, this selection appears
also in the URL of your browser and can be used as a permalink
to this filter.
