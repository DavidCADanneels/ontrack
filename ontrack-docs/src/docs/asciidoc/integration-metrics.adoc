=== Monitoring

Ontrack is based on http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot[Spring Boot] and
exports metrics and health indicators that can be used to monitor the status
of the applications.

[[monitoring-health]]
==== Health

The `/manage/health` end point provides a JSON tree which indicates the status
of all connected systems: JIRA, Jenkins, Subversion repositories, Git
repositories, etc.

Note than an administrator can have access to this information as a dashboard
in the _Admin console_ (accessible through the user menu).

[[monitoring-metrics]]
==== Metrics

[WARNING]
====
Since version 2.35 / 3.35, Ontrack uses the http://micrometer.io/[Micrometer]
framework to manage metrics, in order to allow a better integration with
http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/[Spring Boot 2].

See <<appendix-metrics-migration>> for information about the migration.
====

By default, Ontrack supports two external registries for metrics:

* InfluxDB
* Prometheus

The export to those engine is _disabled_ by default and must be enabled
explicitely.

For example, for Prometheus, you can use the
`management.metrics.export.prometheus.enabled` property or
the `MANAGEMENT_METRICS_EXPORT_PROMETHEUS_ENABLED` environment variable.

For the rest of the configuration, you have to consult the
Spring Boot or Micrometer documentation.

[[monitoring-metrics-list]]
===== List of metrics

[NOTE]
====
The list of Ontrack specific metrics and their tags and values is available
using the `/manage/ontrack_metrics` endpoint. Note that this endpoint
needs authentication and some <<security,administrator privileges>>.
