==== Extending metrics

[WARNING]
====
Starting from version 2.35, the metrics framework used by
Ontrack has been migrated to http://micrometer.io/[Micrometer].
This is a breaking change - and the way metrics can be
contributed to by extensions is totally different and
some effort must be done in the migration.
====

In order for extensions to add their own metrics, they can
interact directly with an inject `MeterRegistry` and then
get gauges, timers, counters, etc.

Or they can create some `MeterBinder` beans to register
some gauges at startup time.

Usually, migrating (monotonic) counters and timers will
be straightforward:

[source,kotlin]
----
val meterRegistry: MeterRegistry
meterRegistry.counter("...", tags).increment()
meterRegistry.timer("...", tags).record(...)
----

For gauge, you have to register them so that they can
be call at any time by the meter registry:

[source,kotlin]
----
val meterRegistry: MeterRegistry
meterRegistry.gauge("...", tags,
    sourceObject,
    { obj -> ... }
)
----

See the http://micrometer.io/[Micrometer] documentation
for more information on how to register metrics.
