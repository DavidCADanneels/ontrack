=== Managing validation runs

<<model,Validation runs>> associate a validation stamp
to a build, and a status describing the validation: passed,
failed, etc.

Additionally, a <<model,run info>> can be associated with
the validation run to show information like a duration,
a source or a trigger.

Validation runs can be created manually, but more often,
they will be created automatically by a CI engine like
<<integration-jenkins,Jenkins>>.

Validation runs can be seen:

* in the branch overview - only their latest status is
  then visible

* in the branch overview, by clicking on a validation run
  (at the intersection of a validation stamp and a build),
  you can either create a new validation run (when there is
  none) or see the list of them and their statuses.

* in the build page

* in the validation stamp page

For one validation run, one can add comments and update
the status to reflect (for example, to mention that
a failure in under investigation).
