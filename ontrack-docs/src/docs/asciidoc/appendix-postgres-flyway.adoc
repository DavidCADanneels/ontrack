=== Postgres and Flyway

The creation and updates of the Ontrack schema in Postgres is managed using https://flywaydb.org/[Flyway].

The configuration is initialized in the `net.nemerosa.ontrack.repository.RepositoryConfig` class and SQL files
are stored in `ontrack-database/src/main/resources/ontrack/sql`.

WARNING: As of now, <<extending,extensions>> cannot contribute to the schema.

The actual migration is processed using the `net.nemerosa.ontrack.service.support.StartupStrategy` component. Once
the database has been upgraded, all `StartupService` implementations are started in heir specified order.
