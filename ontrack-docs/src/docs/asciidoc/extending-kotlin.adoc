[[extending-kotlin]]
==== Using Kotlin in extensions

An <<extending, extension>> can use http://kotlinlang.org/[Kotlin]
additionally to Java.

Just mention `kotlin()` in the Ontrack configuration in your
`build.gradle` file:

[source,groovy]
.build.gradle
----
ontrack {
    kotlin()
    ...
}
----

The Kotlin Gradle plug-in will be automatically applied and the Kotlin
JVM for JRE8, with the same version than for Ontrack, will be added
in `compileOnly` mode to your dependencies. Enjoy!
