===== Forms

Simple input forms do not need a lot of effort to design in Ontrack. They
can be used directly in pages or in modal dialogs.

Server components (controllers, services, ...) are creating instances of the
`Form` object and the client libraries (`service.form.js`) is responsible
for their rendering:

====== Form object

The `Form` object is created by adding `Field`s into it using its `with` method:

[source,java]
----
import net.nemerosa.ontrack.model.form.Form;
public Form getMyForm() {
   return Form.create()
      .with(field1)
      .with(field2)
      ;
}
----

See the next section on how to create the field objects. The `Form` object
contains utility methods for common fields:

[source,java]
----
Form.create()
   // `name` text field (40 chars max), with "Name" as a label
   // constrained by the `[A-Za-z0-9_\.\-]+` regular expression
   // Suitable for most name fields on the Ontrack model objects
   // (projects, branches, etc.)
   .name()
   // `password` password field (40 chars max) with "Password" as a label
   .password()
   // `description` memo field (500 chars max), optional, with "Description"
   // as a label
   .description()
   // `dateTime` date/time field (see below) with "Date/time" as a label
   .dateTime()
   // ...
   ;
----

In order to fill the fields with actual values, you can either use the
`value(...)` method on the field object (see next section) or use
the `fill(...)` method on the `Form` object.

[source,java]
----
Map<String, ?> data = ...
Form.create()
   // ...
   // Sets `value` as the value of the field with name "fieldName"
   .fill("fieldName", value)
   // Sets all values in the map using the key as the field name
   .fill(data)
