== DSL

Ontrack provides several ways of interaction:

* the graphical user interface (GUI)
* the REST API (UI - also used internally by the GUI)
* the Domain Specific Language (DSL)

Using the DSL, you can write script files which interact remotely with your
Ontrack instance.

[[dsl-usage]]
=== DSL Usage

In some cases, like when using the
https://github.com/nemerosa/ontrack-jenkins[Ontrack Jenkins plug-in], you can
just write some Ontrack DSL to use it, because the configuration would have
been done for you.

In some other cases, you have to set-up the Ontrack DSL environment yourself.

[[dsl-usage-embedded]]
==== Embedded

You can embed the Ontrack DSL in your own code by importing it.

Using Maven:

      <dependencies>
         <groupId>net.nemerosa.ontrack</groupId>
         <artifactId>ontrack-dsl</artifactId>
         <version>{{ontrack-version}}</version>
      </dependencies>

Using Gradle:

      compile 'net.nemerosa.ontrack:ontrack-dsl:{{ontrack-version}}'

[[dsl-usage-shell]]
==== Standalone shell

Future versions of https://github.com/nemerosa/ontrack/issues/198[Ontrack] will
have a standalone executable JAR that you can call from the shell.

[[dsl-usage-connection]]
==== Connection

Before calling any DSL script, you have to configure an `Ontrack` instance
which will connect to your remote Ontrack location:

[source,java]
----
import net.nemerosa.ontrack.dsl.*;

String url = "http://localhost:8080";
String user = "admin";
String password = "admin";

Ontrack ontrack = OntrackConnection.create(url)
   // Logging
   .logger(new OTHttpClientLogger() {
      public void trace(String message) {
         System.out.println(message);
      }
   })
   // Authentication
   .authenticate(user, password)
   // OK
   .build();
----

[[dsl-usage-calling]]
==== Calling the DSL

The Ontrack DSL is expressed through Groovy and can be called using the
`GroovyShell`:

[source,java]
----
import groovy.lang.Binding;
import groovy.lang.GroovyShell;

Ontrack ontrack = ...

Map<String, Object> values = new HashMap<>();
values.put("ontrack", ontrack);
Binding binding = new Binding(values);

GroovyShell shell = new GroovyShell(binding);

Object shellResult = shell.evaluate(script);
