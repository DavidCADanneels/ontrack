==== Free text annotations

Some free text can be entered as description for some
elements of the <<model,model>> and can be automatically extended
with hyperlinks.

[NOTE]
====
As-of now, only the descriptions entered for the
<<validation-runs,validation run statuses>> are supported
but this will be extended to other elements in the future.
====

Such link expansions are done for:

* raw hyperlinks in the text
* issue references, depending on the project configuration

For example, if one enters the following text as
a validation run status:

```
For more information, see http://nemerosa.github.io/ontrack/
```

the link will be rendered as such:

If the project is configured with JIRA, any reference
will be converted to a link to the issue. So a text like

```
See CLOUD-6800
```

would be rendered as:

image::images/extension-free-text-annotations-jira.png[JIRA,400]

Same thing for GitHub or GitLab, a text like:

```
See #631
```

will be rendered as:
