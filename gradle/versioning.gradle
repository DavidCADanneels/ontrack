/**
 * Versioning policy.
 *
 * The following information must be collected:
 *      - the full version - will be used for the project's version.
 *      - the base version - version information without the build number
 *      - the build version - the build number
 *      - the commit - the commit for this version
 *
 * The way this information is collected depends on the environment:
 *
 * - from a tag (we want to build from a tag)
 *     - the working copy is associated with a tag
 *     - the information is computed from the tag name: <full> = <base>-<build>
 *     - commit = current commit
 *
 * - in a build environment:
 *     - the working copy is not associated with a tag
 *     - the BUILD_NUMBER environment variable is available
 *     - base = projectVersion (from the gradle.properties file)
 *     - build = BUILD_NUMBER
 *     - <full> = <base>-<build>
 *     - commit = current commit
 *
 * - in development mode
 *     - the working copy is not associated with a tag
 *     - the BUILD_NUMBER environment variable is not available
 *     - base = projectVersion (from the gradle.properties file)
 *     - build = DEV
 *     - <full> = <base>-<build>
 *     - commit = current commit
 *
 * - from a tag (we want to build from a tag)
