Expression that describes the relationship between the tag names and the build names.<br/>
It is an expression where <code>*</code> can be used as a placeholder.<br/>
If using <code>(...)</code>, the part in parenthesis if the build name.<br/>
If no parenthesis is used, the whole match is meant as build name.<br/>
It defaults to <code>*</code>, meaning that we have a 1:1 relationship between the tag and the build name.
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>2.0.*</code> - only tag names starting with <code>2.0.</code> can be considered as builds. The tag
    name is the same as the build name.</li>
    <li><code>v(2.0.*)</code> - only tag names starting with <code>v2.0.</code> can be considered as builds and
    the build name is created from the tag name by removing the <code>v</code> prefix.</li>
</ul>
