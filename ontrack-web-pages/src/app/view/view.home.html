<p>ontrack will allow you to monitor and control the state of your continuous delivery pipeline, for all your projects and all their branches.</p>

<p>By qualifying the builds with <em>promotion levels</em> and <em>validation stamps</em>, ontrack will help you assert the quality of your applications.</p>

<p>Integrating with your CI engine, your ticketing system and your SCM, ontrack will allow you to check the content of your builds by accessing the change logs, by asserting the promotion level for a given issue, and many other possibilities.</p>

<p>You can go even further by using ontrack in turn to drive your pipeline, since its REST API can be used to get the builds with the desired quality.</p>
