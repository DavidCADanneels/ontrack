Ontrack release cycle
=====================

## Overview

The release cycle goes about:

1. developments are done on the `develop` and the `feature/*` branches
1. developments targeted for the next release must be merged into the `develop` branch
1. when release `R.X` is ready for stabilisation, create the `release/R.X` branch from the `develop` one
1. fix any remaining issue on the `release/R.X` branch
1. when ready to actually release, merge the `release/R.X` branch into the `master`, tag, build and publish.

Merge regularly the `release/*` branches into the `develop` branch.

## Pipelines

For all branches:

* packaging
* local acceptance tests (using a local Docker image)

For `release/*` branches:

* deploying in a acceptance server

For `master` branch:

* deploying in production (manual, optional)

## Acceptance deployment and tests
