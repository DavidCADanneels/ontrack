Docker support
==============

`ontrack` can be installed as a Docker container.

## Installation of ontrack

To build the `ontrack` image:

    docker build -t="nemerosa/ontrack" .
    


## nginx link

*To be continued.*

> The idea is to have `nginx` run as a separate container that links to the `ontrack` container.
